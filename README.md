Drought Management 
This is an AICTE Internship
üåç This project develops an AI/ML-powered climate risk management system to combat rising temperatures and drought. By combining satellite data (NASA Earthdata, NOAA, xView2) 
with advanced models like LSTM, ARIMA, and remote sensing, it predicts heatwaves, monitors drought severity, and assesses agricultural stress. 
Using reinforcement learning, the system optimizes resource allocation‚Äîwater, food, and medical supplies‚Äîfor maximum impact. 
It also generates risk maps that highlight vulnerable regions by integrating climate, population, and infrastructure data.
The result is a decision-support tool that empowers governments, NGOs, and disaster agencies to act early, protect livelihoods, 
and build resilience against climate-driven crises.
